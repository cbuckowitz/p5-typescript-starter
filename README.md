# p5 Typescript Starter

Starter template for using [p5](https://p5js.org/) with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), forked off Gareth William's https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter.

Just mentioning, there is a great javascript based [live editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) on the p5 site.

This is opinionated to just work with typescript and intellisense in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), local or as a [remote container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). It also can be imported to [glitch](https://glitch.com/) or similar container based environments.


## Usage

### VSCode
Clone and npm install and run start or [clone repository into container volume](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume) to work in a remote container.

### Glitch
Just clone the repo into a new project. Check the logs, it takes a while to prepare.
